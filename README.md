# Wifi Buttons 
 A simple avr application which uses an esp8266 wifi chip to send mqtt messages when a button is pressed.

## Building 
 - Arduino-Makefile is a submodule of this repo so run "git submodule init", and "git submodule update" first.
 - You will then need to configure the Arduino-Makefile/Arduino.mk file to point to the right folders
 - You will need to install the arduino libraries espduino, and SoftwareSerial (if it isn't already installed)
